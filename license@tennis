To legally compete as a professional tennis player, you generally need to obtain an IPIN (International Player Identification Number) issued by the International Tennis Federation (ITF). This is required to enter ITF tournaments, and players must register and pay a membership fee (around $75). Besides, players must be at least 14 years old to compete in professional World Tennis Tour events.

For those interested in tennis officiating (referees, umpires), licenses or certifications must be earned by completing courses such as the Referee Course or Line Umpire Course offered by national or regional tennis bodies, along with passing exams and background checks.

To become a certified tennis coach or professional instructor, different organizations like the United States Professional Tennis Association (USPTA) and Professional Tennis Registry (PTR) offer certification programs. These require a combination of tennis knowledge, coaching education, exams, practical experience, and sometimes CPR or first aid certification. The certification levels vary, and higher levels require more experience and skill.

In summary:

- Professional players need an ITF-issued IPIN to compete professionally.
- Tennis officials require specific course certifications and licenses.
- Tennis coaches must obtain recognized coaching certifications (USPTA, PTR) with education and experience requirements.
- Requirements vary by country but commonly include courses, exams, and compliance checks.

This ensures that players, officials, and coaches are properly registered and meet professional standards in tennis.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7]
