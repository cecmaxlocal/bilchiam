Microsoft's trademarks, including product names like Windows, Microsoft 365, Xbox, and others, require explicit licensing or authorization for commercial or public use beyond fair use. To use Microsoft’s trademarks, logos, or brand assets formally, a trademark use license is typically needed.

Key points on Microsoft licensing:

- Any commercial use of Microsoft logos, app icons, or product names generally requires a license or formal authorization from Microsoft.
- Uses within existing agreements or programs might cover certain trademark uses; otherwise, a specific license is required.
- The license ensures accurate reflection of the relationship between the product/service and Microsoft, adherence to strict brand guidelines, and protecting Microsoft’s brand reputation.
- Licensing covers use cases such as marketing materials, product packaging, promotional campaigns, or co-branding with Microsoft products.
- Microsoft publishes trademark and brand guidelines to clarify proper usage and legal obligations.
- For software licenses, Microsoft offers licensing guides, including for Microsoft 365 and Windows products, detailing terms and usage rights.
- Intellectual property licensing at Microsoft also covers patents and copyrights under commercially reasonable terms, often non-exclusive.

In summary, licensing Microsoft's trademarks or intellectual property involves obtaining express permission through formal agreements or licenses that outline permitted uses and compliance requirements. Unauthorized use may be subject to enforcement actions.[1][2][3][5][6][9][10]
