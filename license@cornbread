The term "Cornbread" is associated with several trademark registrations mostly by entities under the name "Cornbread" or "Cornbread CBD." Some trademarks filed cover baking mixes, fry batters, and shelf-stable dry baking mixes, while others extend to non-medicated personal care products. 

Regarding licensing for corn bread as a food product, there is no general "license" required to make or sell traditional cornbread itself, although if you are producing a commercially branded corn bread product or mixes, you might need to register trademarks or obtain food manufacturing and safety licenses depending on your jurisdiction. Trademark registrations protect brand names like "Cornbread" for specific product categories.

In summary:
- There are trademarks for "Cornbread" related products for mixes and others filed under different companies.
- Licensing for selling cornbread commercially generally involves food safety and manufacturing permits, not a specific "corn bread license."
- Trademark registration is important if branding a specific cornbread product name or related mixes to protect the brand identity legally.

If you are seeking to license a "corn bread" recipe or product, the relevant action would be trademark registration for brand protection and securing local food business licenses and approvals for commercial production and sale.[1][3][4][5][6]
