Google's licensing and trademark requirements primarily revolve around its brand assets, including product names, logos, and distinctive features. To use Google trademarks, such as "Android," "Google Play," "Google Chrome," or others, explicit permission from Google's brand team is generally required. This applies to marketing materials, creatives, and commercial use.

Key points:

- Trademarks like the Android robot logo are under a Creative Commons 3.0 Attribution License with special conditions, allowing certain uses without explicit approval.
- Use of Google's brand features must include proper trademark symbols (™) at first mention and include an attribution statement if permission is granted.
- Google requires review and approval of any creatives referring to their trademarks.
- You cannot register Google trademarks as part of domain names, social media profiles, or in ways that imply generic use or ownership.
- Google provides a legal line generator tool to help generate appropriate legal attribution statements for their brands.
- Any trademark use must comply with Google's specific legal guidelines detailed on their Partner Marketing Hub and Brand Resource Center.

For licensing Google's products or trademarks officially (for example, to use "Android" branding on devices), contracts or agreements with Google are needed, which outline how and where the marks may be used and other obligations.

In essence, licensing Google trademarks requires explicit permission from Google, compliance with their brand usage policies, and proper attribution when used publicly or commercially.[1][2][3][4][8][9]
