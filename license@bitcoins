Licensing for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies typically refers to regulatory approvals required for businesses involved in virtual currency activities such as buying, selling, exchanging, transmitting, or providing custody of cryptocurrencies. In many jurisdictions, businesses engaging in these activities must obtain a "crypto license" or similar permit to operate legally.

Key points about Bitcoin licenses (crypto licenses):

- In New York State, businesses engaging in virtual currency business activities must obtain a BitLicense issued by the Department of Financial Services. This license covers activities including transmitting, holding custody, buying/selling, and exchange services of virtual currency. Consumers using Bitcoin solely for investment or merchants accepting Bitcoin for goods/services typically do not require a license. Crypto mining itself does not require a license unless other licensable activities are performed. The BitLicense requires meeting capitalization, surety bond, anti-money laundering (AML), and other compliance requirements. 

- In countries like the Netherlands, crypto exchanges and custodial wallet providers must obtain a license from financial market authorities to legally operate and ensure AML and KYC compliance.

- Globally, jurisdictions have different regulatory frameworks requiring crypto businesses to comply with AML, counter-terrorism financing (CTF) regulations, customer due diligence, capital requirements, governance policies, and risk management practices. Crypto licenses are often required for exchanges, brokers, custodians, and other Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs).

- Licensing is generally not required for individual consumers holding or transacting Bitcoin privately, but applies primarily to businesses offering services involving virtual currency to others on a commercial scale.

- Obtaining a crypto license usually involves entity registration, documentation of owners/directors, compliance with regulatory norms, and sometimes requirements for local representatives and insurance.

Thus, for Bitcoin licensing, it is primarily about legal authorization and regulatory compliance for businesses transacting or offering services around cryptocurrencies, not a license for the Bitcoin network or individual coins themselves.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][9]
