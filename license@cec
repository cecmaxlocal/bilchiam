The California Energy Commission (CEC) certification is a mandatory regulatory certification for electrical and electronic products sold in California. It aims to improve energy efficiency, reduce energy consumption, and decrease greenhouse gas emissions.

Key points about CEC certification:

- Established by CEC Appliance Efficiency Regulations since 2005, it covers numerous categories like household appliances, lighting (including LED bulbs), HVAC equipment, and other electrical devices.
- Products must undergo testing in accredited labs and meet CEC energy efficiency standards before they can be sold in California.
- Manufacturers or importers must submit applications with test data and reports to the CEC for review and approval.
- Certification includes regulations such as Title 20 (Appliance Efficiency) and Title 24 (Building Lighting Energy Efficiency) which are periodically updated.
- The certification process involves compliance testing, application submission, passing tests, and registration in the CEC database.
- This certification is critical to ensuring products meet California's strict energy standards and environmental goals.
- Some certifications are voluntary but encouraged for product quality and market acceptance.

In summary, the "license CEC" primarily refers to the certification and regulatory approval required by the California Energy Commission to sell electrical and energy-related products in California, ensuring they meet energy efficiency and environmental standards.[1][2][3][5][7]
